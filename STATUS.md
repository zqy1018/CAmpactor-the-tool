# Badges

We apply for the following badges: 
- **Available**. *CAmpactor* is publicly available. We have a [public Github repository](https://github.com/chuanluocs/CAmpactor) for the original version of *CAmpactor* (*i.e.,* the version at the time of paper submission), and [an enhanced version](https://github.com/zqy1018/CAmpactor-the-tool) for better user experience. 
- **Functional**. We have provided detailed instructions for building and running *CAmpactor* in the README file. 
- **Reusable**. Our implementation is organized in a modular way so that the code can be reused. Furthermore, all the testing benchmarks are available, and we have instructions on how to reproduce the experimental results of *CAmpactor*.
